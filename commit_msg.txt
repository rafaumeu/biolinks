feat(ui): implement profile and link management ui components

Implementation:
- Refactor `auth` views (login, register) and `profile` view to use Blade components.
- Create new `file-input`, `textarea`, and `a` (link) components.
- Update `input` component to support prefixes and `card` component for better padding/layout.
- Add `tailwind.config.js` compatibility file for VS Code tooling.
- Mark Aula 24 and 26 as completed in `task.md` and `project_status.md`.

Context:
- Completes Phase 5 (Frontend & UI) tasks related to Profile and Link management.
- Ensures all UI elements use the new TailwindCSS v4 + DaisyUI design system.
- Standardizes commit message format to resume the project's historical pattern.
